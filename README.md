# Postings

##### This is a simple web application created by me be to display sale postings created by a seller. The website is based of the Python's Django framework. The admin of the site (me) can enter into Django's Admin to add/modify the posts (Sale price, Condition, etc.). I utilized HTML to create static webpages within the site with links to navigate. This site could also use Bootstrap to create a more professional look.

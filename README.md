# Postings

##### This is a simple web application created by me be to display sale postings created by a seller. The website is based of the Python's Django framework. The admin of the site (me) can enter into Django's Admin to add/modify the posts (Sale price, Condition, etc.). I utilized HTML to create static webpages within the site with links to navigate, and Python the build the foundation of the website in the Models, URLs, and Views files. This site could also use Bootstrap to create a more professional look.
